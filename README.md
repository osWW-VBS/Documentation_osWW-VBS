# Introduction

In Standard Model (SM), the non-Abelian nature allows the gauge boson to interact with each other. But, SM only allows charged couplings, i.e. of type WWZ, WWG, etc. but not allow pure neutral couplings like ZZZ, ZZG, ZGG, GGG, etc. Since Z/G has no charge or weak isospin.

But, Physics beyond SM can introduce anomalous Triple Gauge Coupling (TGC) or Quartic Gauge Coupling (QGC), which may allow neutral couplings or increased the charged strength.

Our aim is to measure the anomalous coupling strength of QGC.
